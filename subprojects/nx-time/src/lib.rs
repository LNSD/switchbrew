/// A measurement of a monotonically nondecreasing clock.

/// Instants are always guaranteed, barring [platform bugs], to be no less than any previously
/// measured instant when created, and are often useful for tasks such as measuring
/// benchmarks or timing how long an operation takes.
///
/// Note, however, that instants are **not** guaranteed to be **steady**. In other
/// words, each tick of the underlying clock might not be the same length (e.g.
/// some seconds may be longer than others). An instant may jump forwards or
/// experience time dilation (slow down or speed up), but it will never go
/// backwards.
/// As part of this non-guarantee it is also not specified whether system suspends count as
/// elapsed time or not. The behavior varies across platforms and Rust versions.
///
/// Instants are opaque types that can only be compared to one another. There is
/// no method to get "the number of seconds" from an instant. Instead, it only
/// allows measuring the duration between two instants (or comparing two
/// instants).

/// system.
///
/// [platform bugs]: Instant#monotonicity

/// or operating system bugs. To work around these bugs and platforms not offering monotonic clocks

/// lead to a panic instead. [`checked_duration_since`] can be used to detect and handle situations
/// where monotonicity is violated, or `Instant`s are subtracted in the wrong order.

/// A measurement of the system clock, useful for talking to

/// save another file to the file system, **and the second file has a
/// `SystemTime` measurement earlier than the first**. In other words, an
/// operation that happens after another operation in real time may have an
